Asset   Management
Tutorial   2
Practical applications   of structuring   portfolios for different clients
Question   1:
Case studies of   investor types and their   preferences
You   are   an   investment   advisor   with   three    new    private   clients.   You   can    use   the   template   included   below. You are   provided with   the   information shown   below and   need   to:
a)       Formulate the   investment objectives   and   constraints   for   each   client.
b)       Recommend   which   asset   classes   and   investment   strategy   are    most   appropriate   to   each   client
c)       Outline   further    questions   you   would    need   answered    before   you   could   arrive   at   a   final   strategy for each   client
Client   1
Has £300,000 to   place   under   management.    He   has   no other   significant   assets   except   for   the   house   he   lives   in   (he   has already   repaid the   mortgage). The client   is two years   away from retirement and does   not   have   a   pension.
Client   2Has    US$3   million   to   invest   and   lives   in   Grand   Cayman.       He    has    homes    in    the    US,    UK    and   Switzerland   and   a   sizeable   income from   a   laundry   business.      He wishes to take   advantage   of   investing   in alternative   instruments and gain exposure to   international   markets.
Client   3Is   an   equity trader   in   a   major financial   center with   US$10,000   a   month to   invest.       Has   no job   security   and   is   unlikely   to   be   in   one   job   long   enough   to   accumulate   a   significant   company   pension.      Has   strong   views   on   investment   but   is   constrained   by   the   compliance   department   of   his employer on   his choice   of   investments.


Suggested framework for organising the answer in Question   1   for   each   client:
RETURN
RISK
TIME   HORIZON
LIQUIDITY
LEGAL
TAX
UNIQUE   NEEDS
INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Year   1
Year   2
Year   3
Asset A
+5%
+12%
-8%
Asset   B
+6%
+5%
+1%
Calculate the
a)       the   covariance   between   the   two   assets’ returns   and
b)      the   correlation   between   the   two   assets’ returns
Assume the data shown   are the   population   data.
Question   3
A   portfolio   is   70% invested   in   an   index   fund   and   30% in   a   risk-free   asset. The   index   fund has   a   standard   deviation   of   returns   of   15%. Calculate   the   standard   deviation   for   the   total   portfolio returns.


Question 4
You are a wealth   manager. One   of your   clients   has   $10   million   invested   in   long-term corporate   bonds. This   bond   portfolio’s expected annual   rate of   return   is 9%,   and   the   annual   standard deviation   is   10%.
You try to   persuade your client to   invest   in an   index fund that   closely   tracks   the   Standard      Poor’s   500   Index. The   index   has an expected   return of   14%, and   its   standard   deviation   is 16%.
a)       Suppose your client   invests all   her   funds   in   a   combination   of the   index   fund   and   Treasury   bills. Can the client   improve   her expected   rate   of   return without   changing   the   risk   of   his portfolio? The Treasury   bill yield   is 6%.
b)       Could you do even   better   by   investing   equal   amounts   in the   corporate   bond   portfolio      and the   index fund? The correlation   between the   bond   portfolio and the   index fund   is   +0.1.
Question   5
A   portfolio   is   entirely   invested   in   two   assets, with   standard   deviations   of   10% and   15%,   respectively. The correlation   between the   assets   is   –1.
What   percentage of the   portfolio should   be   invested   in each   asset to   completely   eliminate   portfolio   risk?
Hint:   to solve   this, you   will need to remember the binomial   formula   (a-b)2    = a2    +   b2   – 2ab
